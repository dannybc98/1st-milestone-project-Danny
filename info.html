            <h1>Transportation <i class="fa-solid fa-car"></i></h1>
            <p>Transportation in Madeira Island offers various options to explore its beautiful landscapes.
                Renting
                a car provides
                flexibility and accessibility to remote areas, but be prepared for challenging roads. The
                extensive
                public bus network
                is a more affordable choice for getting around major towns and attractions. Taxis, private
                transfers, and cable cars are
                available for convenient transportation. Joining sightseeing tours with local guides can enhance
                the
                experience, while
                walking, hiking, and bicycle rentals cater to more adventurous travelers. Plan ahead and check
                for
                updates to ensure a
                smooth trip on this stunning island.</p>

            <h1>Passport & Visa Requirements <i class="fa-solid fa-passport"></i></h1>
            <p>For travelers visiting Madeira Island, ensure your passport is valid for the duration of your
                stay. As a Portuguese
                territory, entry requirements are typically the same as mainland Portugal. Citizens from the
                European Union (EU) and
                Schengen Area countries can enter with a valid ID card, while non-EU nationals may need a
                Schengen visa. Always check
                the latest visa regulations before your trip to ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience.</p>
