            <img src="assets/images/madeirabeach.jpg" alt="beach">
            <p>While the island is not known for its typical sandy shores, it boasts several pebble and rock beaches,
                each with its own
                distinct charm. Praia Formosa, with its striking seafront promenade, invites relaxation and captivating
                sunsets. Praia
                da Calheta, with its golden sand imported from Morocco, offers a more traditional beach experience,
                complete with clear
                waters perfect for swimming. Prainha de Cani√ßal's secluded cove provides an intimate setting for a
                peaceful day by the
                sea. Madeira's beaches may be different from the conventional tropical paradises, but they hold a
                certain allure that
                complements the island's rugged terrain and mesmerizing landscapes, making them a unique and refreshing
                escape for
                visitors.</p>
